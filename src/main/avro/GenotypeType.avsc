This\n   most commonly occurs if a diploid sample's genotype contains one reference\n   and one variant allele, but can also occur if the genotype contains multiple\n   alternate alleles.\n * HOM_ALT: All genotypes at this site were called as a single alternate allele.\n * NO_CALL: The genotype could not be called at this site.",
